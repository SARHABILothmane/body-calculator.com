              <nb-accordion-item-body>
                <p>Body mass index is known as a way to estimate body fat according to human weight and height. Studies
                  have shown that high body mass index (BMI) is significantly associated with the risk of developing
                  chronic diseases such as heart disease, hypertension, and adult grade 2 diabetes.</p>
                <p>The body mass index (BMI) gives a reasonable estimate of body fat in women, men, young, or elderly
                  body's, but there are limits to this older people, <br>
                  For example : have low muscle mass, and underestimated body fat, but for fit or very muscular people
                  they have overestimated fat.

              <nb-accordion-item-body>
                <p>Although the BMI is widely used and widely used, it has limitations; ultimately, it is merely an
                  estimate of body composition that cannot be taken into account because of our different body types,
                  muscles, bones, and fat mass.</p>
                <p>For people to measure their weight properly, other methods must be used in addition to the BMI. </p>

              </nb-accordion-item-header>
              <nb-accordion-item-body>
                <p> In calculating the BMI for adult women and men doctors said it is not reliably accurate because it
                  measures not only excess fat but also excess body weight as a whole. Measurement may be influenced by
                  other factors, including age, gender, or ethnicity, as well as activity level and fat mass.</p>
                <p>On the contrary, older people measured with BMI have a healthy weight, regardless of whether their
                  activity is limited, and their excess fat mass is not heavy. If we look at the bodies of bodybuilders
                  we will find that their weight isn't healthy according to BMI because they are heavyweight. </p>
                <p> After all, they have a great number of muscles so their bodies are healthy according to the CCD.</p>

                  effectiveness of the mass index in adults will negatively affect their sexual and physical maturity.
                </p>
                <p>The body mass index and body fat index in children vary according to obesity and thinness. This
                  difference is due to the fat-free mass.</p>

              <nb-accordion-item-body>
                <p>You may ask yourself if BMI is reliable or not, so I will give you the answer, as mentioned earlier
                  that BMI is the way to estimate body fats using weight and height.
                </p>
                <p> The importance of BMI is represented in how it helps to limit the risk of Chronic disease incidences
                  like diabetes, liver
                  disease, high blood pressure, several types of cancer, and sleep apnea, but it's not a perfect test
                  for pregnant women and high muscle mass, and it may not be good in
                  measuring the health of children.</p>
                <p>According to WHO millions of people died due to being overweight so
                  people with high BMI Are prone to chronic diseases.

              <nb-accordion-item-body>
                <p>There are three types of people who should not perform BMI because BMI shows incorrect results. </p>
                <ol type="1">
                  <li>First pregnant women This is because the bodies of pregnant women undergo several changes during
                    this period, so it is not measured correctly.</li>
                  <li>Second for muscle builders, their body mass can be given as a wrong indication of obesity, but
                    it's a wrong measure, because their body's muscle percentage is higher than fat, and that's not
                    considered obesity.</li>
                  <li>Third for people of Asian origin, Asian people, in particular, have an accumulation of abdominal
                    fat that makes their bodies look like apples, not pears, as other people do. So they have a lower
                    BMI than people of Caucasian origin. The fat mass is concentrated in the stomach Therefore, most of
                    these people experience heart problems, blood pressure, and diabetes.</li>

              </nb-accordion-item-header>
              <nb-accordion-item-body>
                <p>Some people believe that waist circumference is a way of determining whether an individual's body is
                  healthy, but it is actually a screening tool and is not fully relied upon to determine an individual's
                  health. </p>
                <p> To measure your waist circumference correctly you have to stand and place a tape measure around your
                  middle correctly above your hip bones. Keep the tape around your wish then breathe out and measure
                  your waist.</p>
                <p> People with a very big waist circumference are about to have different kinds of diseases like
                  diabetes and high blood pressure. Pregnant women aren't allowed to measure their waist because their
                  bodies are not in their normal shape.</p>

        <h2 class="text-secondary">In what ways is the BMI for women inaccurate?</h2>
        <p>
          Weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared is used to calculate BMI. Underweight, healthy
          weight, overweight, and obesity are all indicated by the resultant number.
        </p>
        <p>BMI is often used by doctors to get a sense of how healthy you are as a whole. For women, however, the
          picture is hazier when it comes to BMI.</p>
        <p>
          When it comes to assessing overall health, BMI is an excellent tool. This isn't a custom match for each
          person," adds Dempers. Furthermore,
          the reliability of this test as a health indicator may be affected by gender variations. When it comes to
          body fat,
          women tend to have more of it than men do. A separate BMI chart for women isn't available.

        <h2 class="text-secondary">There are drawbacks to using BMI to assess women's health.</h2>
        <p>BMI is a hotly debated tool, with many health professionals believing it should be abolished. In the 18th
          century, when BMI was first created, it relied heavily on data gleaned from the remains of the dead.</p>
        <p>Dempers points out that the average height and weight of both sexes have risen since then.</p>
        <h3 class="text-secondary">A sportsperson</h3>
        <p>In general, the more physically active you are, the more muscle mass you tend to accumulate. "According to
          Dempers, "BMI does not come into consideration muscle mass or body fat, hence it is worthless for athletes."
        </p>
        <p>According to Mcdonough, muscles with a greater density also weigh more. "As a consequence, BMI measurements
          are distorted. "The vast majority of athletes are likely to be overweight or obese."</p>
        <h3 class="text-secondary">Postmenopausal</h3>
        <p>'The older you are, the more body fat you tend to accumulate,' explains Mcdonough. "Hormone levels fall in
          women going through menopause. Muscle mass declines and abdominal fat rises as a result of a drop in hormone
          levels."</p>
        <p>Your <a routerLink="/health/body-fat-percentage-calculator/." rel="noopener">body fat percentage</a> may be
          significantly higher at 70 than it was at 30 despite the fact that your weight is the same. Despite their
          healthy BMI, some postmenopausal women have been found to be overweight or obese, according to new research.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-secondary">Other than white, a race or ethnicity</h3>
        <p>Body fat distribution and muscle mass are affected by ethnicity. Women of Mexican heritage had greater body
          fat than white and black females in recent research. The study also revealed that black women had higher
          muscle mass than white women or Mexican-American women. However, BMI does not take these variances into
          consideration.</p>
        <p>In Mcdonough's opinion, "your ethnicity might produce a mistake in your BMI figure. A person's health and
          risk of obesity-related disorders might vary greatly even though they have the same BMI.</p>
        <p>Varying ethnic groups, such as white, black, and South Asian/Middle Eastern are at greater risk of
          acquiring Type 2 diabetes at different BMI levels. Learn more about why individuals of color are more likely
          to suffer from health disparities due to BMI.</p>
        <h2 class="text-secondary">Measure weight and health in five different ways (with or without BMI)</h2>
        <p>A temperature check on your health may be done in a variety of methods, according to Dempers and Mcdonough.
          If you have a high BMI, don't let that discourage you." A little portion of the whole image. If you're still
          not sure, go to your doctor or another health care provider," says Mcdonough.</p>

            rel="noopener" target="_blank">X-ray absorption spectroscopy (DEXA)</a></h3>
        <p>Using DEXA, you may determine your bone mass, muscle mass, and fat proportion. According to Mcdonough, "you
          get a sharper image of your physical composition."</p>
        <h3 class="text-secondary">A body fat analyzer that uses an electronic sensor</h3>
        <p>Scales with body fat scanners are becoming more commonplace. According to Dempers, "They have metal plates
          on them that transmit a little current through your body to give you a ballpark approximation of what your
          body fat percentage is" "Even though their accuracy ranges from plus or minus seven standard deviations,
          they nonetheless provide a decent general estimate."</p>
        <h3 class="text-secondary">Mirror</h3>
        <p>According to Dempers, staring in the mirror may be therapeutic, despite the fact that it may appear archaic
          or even upsetting to some people. For those who find it challenging, remember that it's not about being
          picky. Instead, it might be a useful tool to track your progress as you work toward your health objectives,"
          he says.</p>
        <h3 class="text-secondary">An essential body fat percentage (EBFF) calliper with a skinfold reading</h3>
        <p>As Dempers explains, "Your essential body fat percentage" (EBF) is the basic minimum of body fat required
          to maintain good health and proper brain function.</p>
        <p>An athletic trainer, for example, would be an excellent choice to do a six-site test on you using callipers
          that resemble tongs. According to Mcdonough, the test "shows your body fat percentage and whether or not you
          have higher muscle density than your BMI implies. An ideal vital body fat range for females is 25-31%,
          according to the study.</p>

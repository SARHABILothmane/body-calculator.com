          rel="noopener noreferrer">Healthy Weight Calculator</a></h2>
      <p>
        BMI is used to define a good weight level. BMI-based weight categories are established by height, and the
        calculator employs common methods to estimate the range of probable body weights that fit inside each
        category.
      </p>
      <p>
        A BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2 is considered healthy or normal for those over the age of 18.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information about "healthy body weight" may be found on the BMI Calculator, but keep in mind that it relies on
        estimates that don't take into consideration things like body composition.
      </p>
      <p>It's possible to be overweight or underweight and yet be considered "healthy," but this needs more than a
        broad calculation to determineâ€”likely with the advice of a medical practitioner.</p>

      <h2 class="text-secondary">Being underweight, overweight, or obese might have a negative impact on your health.
      </h2>
      <h3>-BMI less than 18.5:</h3>
      <p>A person may be underweight for a variety of reasons, including genetics, a lack of food, problems with their
        metabolism, medication, or a medical condition. Hyperthyroidism, cancer, and TB are just a few of the many
        medical disorders that are related with being underweight.</p>
      <p>Underweight people have death rates that are equivalent to severely obese people. Even though these death
        rates are impacted by illness-related weight loss, being underweight may not have considerably higher
        mortality rates than being of healthy weight in the absence of underlying disease.</p>
      <!-- <br> -->
      <p>Being underweight may create a host of additional problems, including a lack of energy or endurance,
        osteoporosis, and a weak immune system that makes a person more vulnerable to infection.</p>
      <p>Malnourishment is a concern for those who are underweight as a result of inadequate diet rather than
        excessive exercise or other reasonable factors. their physical and mental health.</p>
      <p>Kwashiorkor and marasmus, the most severe types of malnutrition, may occur in the most extreme situations.
      </p>
      <!-- <br> -->
      <p>Being underweight as a consequence of an eating problem may cause menstruation to stop, infertility to set
        in, and even pregnancy to be complicated.</p>
      <h3>-<a routerLink="/health/bmi-calculator/.">Body mass index (BMI)</a> between 25-30:</h3>
      <p>Consuming more calories than the body expends via metabolic processes and physical activity is the most
        common cause of obesity, according to experts. Alcoholism, a genetic predisposition, eating disorders, a
        sedentary lifestyle, poor nutrition, and stress are all factors that may contribute to obesity.</p>
      <p>There is a lot of debate over the detrimental impacts of being overweight compared to being obese. Most
        people agree that being overweight has some of the same problems as being obese, although to a lower degree.
        However, research has shown that overweight persons have a lower death risk than those who are considered a
        healthy weight.</p>
      <p> Some argued that a BMI range of 25-30, which is currently categorized as overweight, maybe ideal, Some
        contend that death is not the only measure of health, but that obesity increases the risk of diabetes, heart
        disease, and various types of cancer...</p>
      <h3>-Obese people have a body mass index (BMI) above 30.</h3>
      <p>In most cases, obesity is the result of a lack of exercise, overeating, and hereditary predisposition.</p>
      <p>Obesity may be caused by genetics, hormonal imbalances owing to endocrine problems, drugs, or mental issues
        in a small number of instances. While obesity may be prevented by making lifestyle and food modifications,
        there is still a lack of awareness of all the contributing aspects.</p>
      <p>Personal management of energy intake and output may be simplified, but it's typically more complicated and
        there is no algorithmic answer for dealing with obesity in society.</p>
      <p>Heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes, musculoskeletal problems such as osteoarthritis, and various
        malignancies are all linked to obesity, which is a major risk factor.</p>
      <p>Obstructive sleep apnea and depression may also result from it (or sometimes be caused by depression).
        Obesity is one of the major avoidable causes of mortality in the world because of all the possible
        consequences associated with it.</p>
      <h2 class="text-secondary">The Importance of Maintaining a Healthy Weight</h2>
      <p>Obesity may cause a wide range of health problems depending on your starting weight, current weight, and <a
          routerLink="/health/body-fat-percentage-calculator/.">body fat percentage</a>. It is necessary to address
        many
        of the same underlying factors, including food, exercise, and probable mental health concerns, in order to
        manage these diseases.</p>
      <p>Underweight people may gain weight in a healthy way by consuming more nutrient-rich foods like whole grains,
        veggies, lean protein sources, and nuts and seeds on a more regular basis.</p>
      <p>A person's weight might also rise if they do weightlifting to build muscular mass as well. When an eating
        disorder like anorexia or bulimia nervosa is the root cause of a person's underweight condition, treating the
        mental health issue as well as the physical weight gain is necessary.</p>
      <p>Like being underweight, being overweight or obese may be addressed to a considerable extent with dietary and
        activity modifications.</p>
      <p>While calorie-dense foods, total fats, and sweets should be avoided in favor of a diet rich in fruits,
        vegetables, and legumes, whole grains and nuts should be consumed more often.</p>
      <p>Additionally, it advises that adults and children alike engage in at least 150 minutes of physical exercise
        each week.</p>
      <p>Only when people have access to education, inexpensive and healthier dietary options, and changes other than
        a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages or reductions in the sugar and salt content of processed foods, as well as
        decreased marketing to children and adolescents, can individual responsibility be fully effective.</p>
